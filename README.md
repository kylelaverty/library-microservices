## Summary
üìñ A practical and fictitious microservices project for a library system with the latest technology and architecture like Verticle Slice Architecture, DDD.

üí° This project was created as a learning opportunity and was focused on the technical side of things and as such is not business-oriented.

## The Goals of this Project

- ‚úîÔ∏è Using `Vertical Slice Architecture` for `architecture` level.
- ‚úîÔ∏è Using `Domain Driven Design (DDD)` to implement all `business processes` in microservices.
- ‚úîÔ∏è Using `Fast-Endpoints` for all endpoints.
- ‚úîÔ∏è Using `Docker-Compose` and `Kubernetes` for our deployment mechanism.
- ‚úîÔ∏è Using `Kubernetes` to achieve efficient `scaling` and ensure `high availability` for each of our microservices.
- ...

## Technologies - Libraries

- ‚úîÔ∏è **[`.NET 8`](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)** - .NET, including ASP.NET Core
- ‚úîÔ∏è **[`EF Core`](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore)** - Modern object-database mapper for .NET. It supports LINQ queries, change tracking, updates, and schema migrations
- ‚úîÔ∏è **[`FluentValidation`](https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation)** - Popular .NET validation library for building strongly-typed validation rules
- ‚úîÔ∏è **[`Swagger & Swagger UI`](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore)** - Swagger tools for documenting API's built on ASP.NET Core
- ‚úîÔ∏è **[`Serilog`](https://github.com/serilog/serilog)** - Simple .NET logging with fully-structured events

## Structure of Project

In this project, I used [Vertical Slice Architecture](https://www.jimmybogard.com/vertical-slice-architecture/) to structure the files in the various microservices.

I am also creating [dev.to](https://dev.to) articles as I go through the project.
